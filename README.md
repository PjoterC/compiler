A compiler for a c++ like language, done as a university group project. Consists of grammar language grammar (P1), typechecker (P2) and code generator (P3).
Although all 3 parts use similair language syntax, they differ slightly and are not compatible to use them in one compiler, without changes - it was only meant to be a learning experience.
